# Text-to-Insights Using PandasAI

[![image](https://github.com/leeharry709/text-to-insights-pandasai/assets/17789988/79561701-d702-4c97-a3cc-ac4ac15a973b)](https://docs.pandas-ai.com/en/latest/)

PandasAI connects data analysis with natural language, allowing users to ask questions directly to the data (CSV, XLSX, PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery, Databrick, Snowflake, etc.) and receive results using generative AI. This opens up the possibility of assisting non-technical users and stakeholders to do exploratory data analysis on their own by querying what they are curious about with the data, reducing time-to-insights and the number of ad hoc query requests sent to analysts, freeing up more time for them to tackle the next big business problem!

For this project, I wanted to create a dataset on compensation data and use PandasAI to query some common questions and requests that stakeholders and HR business partners have.
